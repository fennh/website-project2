    <h2> MUSIC </h2>
    <p> Music has always been one of my biggest passions. Both of my parents loving music means I've been exposed to a wide range of music, from punk to disco, from a young age. Now, I appreciate & love music from most genres, although (according to my Spotify wrapped) my favourites tend to be indie rock & electronic. Without further ado, here's some of my favourite albums, and why I love them. </p> <br> 

    <div class="strokescontainer"><div class="strokesimage"><img src="is this it.jpg" alt="The Strokes, Is This It"> </div>
        <p class="strokes">
        The Strokes' first album remains a contender for one of the best debuts of all time, and a case could be made for it being one of the most infleuntial albums of all time. Is This It shaped the genre of indie rock, with pretty much all of the biggest guitar bands in the 21st Century<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_2rM8A_1-w"> citing The Strokes as a big influence.</a>The drawling, confident vocals of Julian Casablancas, the irresistably catchy guitar riffs and the uncomplicated but still somehow perfect production mean that even with the album approaching its 20th anniversary, it still arguably hasn't been topped. The indie rock genre has certainly gave us some great albums, but this remains the one to beat.

    <div class="bloomcontainer"><div class="bloomimage"><img src="beach house (1).png" alt="Beach House, Bloom"> </div>
        <p class="bloom">
       The Baltimmore-based duo Beach House have, over 7 albums, solidified their reputation as one of the greatest dream-pop bands. Also taking inspiration from genres such as shoegaze and lo-fi, and bands such as the Cocteau Twins, Beach House have become one of the most critically accliamed bands of recent years. From 2010 to 2015, the band consecutively released three near-perfect albums. In my opinion, 2012's Bloom is the pick of the bunch. The beautiful melodies and poetic lyrics combine beautifully with Victoria Legrand's captivating voice. The duo continued to incorporate live drums more into their sound on Bloom, and the drums are perhaps one of the standout points of this album, especially on tracks such as Lazuli and Wishes. Beach House are one of the best bands making music right now, and Bloom is an album that encapsulates their sound perfectly. </p> </div>
    <div class="blondecontainer"><div class="blondeimage"><img src="frank brocean (1).jpeg" alt="Frank Ocean, Blonde"> </div>
        <p class="blonde">
        Frank Ocean is a contender for one of the most elusive artists of recent years. His first album Channel Orange was incredibly well received, and the promised follow up was highly anticipated. Initially planned for release in 2015, the project that became Blonde was subject to many delays. Eventually with very little notice in 2016, Blonde was one of the standout albums of the year and has remained one of the strongest albums released in recent times. Taking a much more atmoshperic approach than Channel Orange, Blonde has been described as 'avant-garde soul' and as an album that pushes the boundaries of R&B. It is Frank Ocean at his most open and personal, and perhaps most beautiful. Guest background appearances from the likes of James Blake, Rostam, Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood could easily pass you by if you weren't told they were there. The added star quality still doesn't take anything way from Ocean though, who is one of the greatest storytellers in music today. </p> </div>
    <div class="bonivercontainer"><div class="boniverimage"><img src="bon iver (1).jpg" alt="Bon Iver, For Emma Forever Ago"> </div>
        <p class="boniver">
        Bon Iver, the main project of Justin Vernon, have become one of the key bands in the indie folk scene in the 21st Century.Vernon's sound, and subsequently the sound of Bon Iver, has evolved greatly over the years. Their self-releaed debut album, For Emma, Forever Ago, is one of the best indie folk albums of recent times. Recorced in a period of isolation for Vernon, the lyrics are introspective and beautiful. The instrumentals are rich, accompanied with heavy choral arrangments. Brought together with Vernon's soulful and distincitve falsetto, For Emma is more of an experience than an album. With the sound it creates, you almost feel you could have been with Vernon for the album's composition. </p> </div>
