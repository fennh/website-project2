    <h2> 2020 </h2>
    <p> Music has always been one of my biggest passions. Both of my parents loving music means I've been exposed to a wide range of music, from punk to disco, from a young age. Now, I appreciate & love music from most genres, although (according to my Spotify wrapped) my favourites tend to be indie rock & electronic. Without further ado, here's some of my favourite albums, and why I love them. </p> <br> 

    <div class="punishercontainer"><div class="punisherimage"><img src="punisher.jpg" alt="Phoebe Bridgers, Punisher"> </div>
        <p class="punisher">
        Phoebe Bridgers' second solo album catapulted her into the mainstream. The singer-songwriter had received critical acclaim for her 2017 debut Stranger in the Alps, and also for collobrative projects Boygenis and Better Oblivion Community Center. The release of Punisher brought wide success, including a number of Grammy nominations, and consequently had Bridgers make a case for being one of the most promising singer-songwriters around. The songs on Punisher are deeply personal, discussing mental health and past relationships. Some of the highlights include the melancholic Garden Song, the almost pop-rock inspired Kyoto and the incredible closer I Know The End.

    <div class="shorecontainer"><div class="shoreimage"><img src="shore.jpg" alt="Fleet Foxes, Shore"> </div>
        <p class="shore">
       Fleet Foxes are another stalwart of the 21st Century indie folk scene. Shore was released as a surprise in 2020, with lead singer Robin Pecknold composing most of the project himself in isolation. Without the direct influence of the rest of the band, the album perhaps unsuprisingly does mark a chance from the band's previous sound. Further, Pecknold spoke of an aim to create 'warmer' sounding songs, which certainly comes across throughout. Many of the songs also pay homage to late musicians, which Pecknold states was an attempt to 'carry them' in the music. The use of drums, perhaps one of the biggest deviations from Fleet Foxes' previous work, are one of the standouts, particurlarly on lead single Can I Believe You. </p> </div>
    <div class="avalanchescontainer"><div class="avalanchesimage"><img src="avalanches.jpg" alt="The Avalanches, We Will Always Love You"> </div>
        <p class="avalanches">
        The Avalanches have only released 3 albums in 2020 years. All 3 are also quite fantastic, as they prove that quality is definitely better than quantity. One of the pioneers of mdodern electronic music, The Avalanches are renowned for their use of sampling. They continue this with We Will Always Love You, with the songs all still sample driven. However, the new record features notably more guest vocalists than their previous effort. In fact, We Will Always Love You is arguably one of the most star-studded albums of 2020, with appearances from Blood Orange, Jamie xx, MGMT and Johnny Marr just ot name a few. The latter two feature on arguably the standout track of the record, The Divine Chord.  </p> </div> <br>
