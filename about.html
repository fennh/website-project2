    <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
    <p> I'm Fenn. I recently graduated with a degree in Politics, and now I'm back home to figure things out until the world goes back to normal.
     
    <br> <br> I decided to give coding a go as I've always liked working with numbers and logic. I've really enjoyed this 3 week course with Code Nation, I've learnt so many new and important skills. I'll definitely be thinking about a career in tech, and the end goal being eventually finding a career that combines these new skills with the knowledge gained in my degree.
    
    <br> <br> Outside of coding, I love cooking and baking. A good pasta sauce is a speciality, and I'm hoping to use this lockdown to finally master baking some good sourdough bread! I also love and appreciate good films (see the photos below!), and I love hanging out with my dog, Cooper.

    <br> <br> One of my biggest passions, and probably one of my favourite things to do when I have some downtime, is listening to music. I've decided to use this site to talk about my love for music, and some of my favourite albums.</p>
