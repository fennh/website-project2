    <p> Welcome to my website! I made this site as my final project of my 3 week Develop course with Code Nation. Making this site allowed me to use the knowledge I gained in HTML and CSS in a creative way. In this site, I'll talk about the skills I've gained throughout the course, as well as a bit about me and one of my biggest music. Hope you enjoy!</p>
